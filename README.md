If you are going to use this bot, please make sure to leave credit to me in the `/info`, I've put a decent amount of time into making this bot and getting the API aspect of it to work properly. 
## Api
This repository contains code for accessing the 'API' of the game Egg, Inc. Files of note are `ei.py, ei_pb2.py, tools.py, as well as ei.proto`. Between these 4 files you should be able to figure out how to use the API to make any calls you may need. All that I'm showing you how to do is a basic request to get somebody's backup.
## Requirements
This discord bot uses PyCord, pyyaml, and protobuf these can be installed through pip with the following commands:<br>
`pip install pyyaml`<br>
`pip install -U git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord`<br>
`pip install protobuf`
## Issues/Commits
If you see an issue that you know how to fix, feel free to make a pull request and I will look it over and merge it if it passes.
<br /><br />
I am well aware that parts of this bot do not follow 'best practices'. I do not need you telling me this unless you intend to show me what would be better.
